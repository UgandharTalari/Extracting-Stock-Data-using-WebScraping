# Extracting-Stock-Data-using-WebScraping
Not all stock data is available via API in this assignment; you will use web-scraping to obtain financial data. You will be quizzed on your results.    Using beautiful soup we will extract historical share data from a web-page.

This project demonstrates how to extract real-time stock data from a financial website using web scraping techniques. Using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests, you'll learn to:

Fetch HTML content from stock market sites.
Parse and extract key stock information such as price, volume, and historical data.
Handle website structures, tags, and classes to accurately locate the desired data.
The extracted data can then be saved for further analysis or visualization using tools like Pandas enabling insights into market trends and price fluctuations.
